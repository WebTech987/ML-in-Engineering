Project Title: Applications of Machine Learning in Frugal Engineering

In this project, titled "Applications of Machine Learning in 
Frugal Engineering," which is part of dual degree curriculum at the 
Indian Institute of Technology Madras, we explore the integration of 
machine learning techniques to optimize production processes, reduce 
costs, and enhance product durability within the context of frugal 
engineering. The mid-term phase of the project includes data 
collection, feature selection, data preprocessing, and the 
development of a robust defect prediction model. Overcoming challenges 
in data acquisition and feature selection, we have created a 
comprehensive dataset, and meticulous data preprocessing has prepared 
it for model development. Our defect prediction model is poised for 
further refinement, integration into manufacturing processes, and 
exploration of advanced analyses, with a commitment to continuous 
learning and model maintenance. This project aims to contribute to 
the optimization of production, improved cost-efficiency, and 
enhanced product durability through the application of machine 
learning in the realm of frugal engineering

# Problem - Statement 
Modern manufacturing faces a challenge: 
balancing costefficiency, resource optimization, and product durability. 
Historically, achieving these goals often resulted in complex, 
costly processes. Frugal engineering principles offer a sustainable 
solution, but practical implementation requires predictive models 
and metrics embodying frugality. This project (Applications of 
Machine Learning in Frugal Engineering - Optimizing the production 
process, cost, and high durability) aims to leverage machine 
learning to predict manufacturing processes and quantify the Factor 
of Frugality. By doing so, it paves the way for manufacturing 
practices that excel in resource efficiency, cost-effectiveness, 
and product longevity. In an era marked by resource constraints and 
sustainability concerns, this project signifies a vital step towards 
a more frugal future in engineering and production
